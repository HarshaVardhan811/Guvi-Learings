//Blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript://

JavaScript is a versatile programming language that has gained immense popularity due to its ability to create interactive web applications.
 At the heart of JavaScript's functionality lies the concept of objects. Objects are the fundamental building blocks of JavaScript, serving as 
 containers for data and behavior. Understanding how objects are represented internally in JavaScript is crucial for mastering the language and 
 developing efficient code.

Objects:

In essence, objects are collections of key-value pairs. These key-value pairs are known as properties, and they store data associated with 
the object. Properties can hold various data types, including primitive data types like numbers, strings, and booleans, as well as other 
objects. Additionally, objects can possess methods, which are functions associated with the object and define its behavior.

Internal Representation of Objects:

JavaScript engines, the software responsible for executing JavaScript code, maintain an internal representation of objects. This representation
 is typically implemented as a hash table, a data structure optimized for storing and retrieving key-value pairs. Each object is assigned a 
 unique identifier, often referred to as its address, which serves as a reference to the object's location in memory.

When an object is created, the JavaScript engine allocates a block of memory to store the object's properties and methods. The object's
 identifier points to this memory location, providing a way to access the object's data and behavior.

Properties and Methods:

Properties are stored within the object's memory block, associated with their respective keys. When accessing a property using dot notation,
 the JavaScript engine retrieves the value associated with the specified key from the object's memory location.

Methods, on the other hand, are stored as functions within the object's memory block. When invoking a method using dot notation, the JavaScript
 engine executes the method's function code, passing the object as the method's context.

Prototypes and Inheritance:

JavaScript objects follow a prototype-based inheritance model. Each object has an internal property called the prototype, which is another 
object. The prototype object serves as a template for the inheriting object, providing default properties and methods that the inheriting
 object can access. This inheritance mechanism allows for code reusability and efficient memory management.


Understanding the internal representation of objects in JavaScript is essential for developing robust and efficient code. By comprehending 
how objects are stored and managed in memory, programmers can optimize their code for performance and memory usage.
